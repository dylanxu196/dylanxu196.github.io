### EXPERIENCE
#### Prof. Lei FU’s group, Wuhan University | Hubei, China								Dec. 2016–Aug. 2018
##### Undergraduate Researcher
**Crystal Field Tuning of Photoluminescence in Lanthanide Ions-Embedded Two-dimensional Materials**
*	Designed precursor of CVD method to prepare individual rare-earth embedded monolayer MoS2 crystal on liquid insulating substrate.
*	Explored Up-conversion property of rare earth ions in 2D material via designing co-doped diverse rare-earth ions.
*	Analyzed temperature-dependent photoluminescence feature of individual rare earth ions in 2D material, and developed 2D crystal field tailoring photoluminescence theory. 

##### Assistant Researcher (expected to resume in Jan. 2019)
**Layered TMDs nanosheets anchored Rigid single-atomic disperse Pt catalyst** 
*	Anchored Pt on S-edge rich MoS2 nanosheets via co-doped transition metal ions-pair strategy.
*	Evaluated the enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction activity on transition metal absorption sites into layered MoS2 
*	Studied the anti-poisoning ability of platinum in hydrogen evolution reaction.

##### Assistant Researcher
**Just like a Spring: Flexible Interlayer Spacing Tuning for 2D Materials**
*	Investigated the interlayer interaction property of MoS2 by large radius transition metal ions doping.
*	Studied charge injection effect of ions intercalation into MoS2 via controllable cyclic voltammetry.
*	Explored the bandgap shift of MoS2 with different interlayer space via photoluminescence spectrum.

#### Prof. Michael Dickey’s group, NCSU | North Carolina, USA					
#### Sep. 2018-Present
##### Visiting Researcher
**Template Coated Liquid Metal Oxidation Spreading for electrochemical synthesis of 2D Ga2O3**
*	Brought the oxidation spreading of liquid metal under control with designed atomic thickness out-skin coat.
*	Evaluated the surface interaction of liquid metal with the dangling bonds of out-skin plane and the coat layer growth behavior under programmed potential
*	Investigated the quality of Ga2O3 film after different annealing condition by optoelectronic characterization.
